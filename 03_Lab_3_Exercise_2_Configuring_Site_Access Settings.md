> d. Click `Create`. Now you see a new Link. 




##### 3. Control whether users can invite others:

> b. `Check Existing users can send invitations to anyone` (if it's not already enabled). 
Now any user on your site can invite new users.
 
> c. If you made a change, click `Save changes`. 
##### 4. Controlling who can join your site: 
> a. Click `Approved domains`. 
* Note: Here we control who can join your site. Currently, no domains are 
approved so all users need to request access or be invited. 

> b. Check `Approve any domain`.
 * Note: Site visitors can now immediately create their own accounts. Your site is now public. You can choose whether to get notified every time a new user gets access to your site by checking the 'Notify all site admins when a new user joins with an approved domain' setting. You should consider the number of users your license supports when deciding whether to allow anyone to join your site. 
 * Note: If you check `Approve the following domains` and enter one, then any user with an email address in that domain can join the site. You'll automatically be notified about any new user. 
> c. Now check `Approve following Domains` and enter `s518528723.online.de` in the `Domains` field. We'll invite users in the next lab. 
Congratulations on completing the lab!
