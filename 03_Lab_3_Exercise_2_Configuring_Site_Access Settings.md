##### 4. Controlling who can join your site: 
> a. Click `Approved domains`. 
* Note: Here we control who can join your site. If no domains are 
approved, all users need to request access or be invited. 

 * Note: If `Any domain is` is chosen, your site is public. You can choose whether to get notified every time a new user gets access to your site by checking the 'Notify all site admins when a new user joins with an approved domain' setting. You should consider the number of users your license supports when deciding whether to allow anyone to join your site. 
 * Note: If you check `Approve the following domains` and enter one, then any user with an email address in that domain can join the site. You'll automatically be notified about any new user. 
> c. Now click the button `Add domain` and enter `s518528723.online.de` in the `Domains` field and click the `Save` button.
