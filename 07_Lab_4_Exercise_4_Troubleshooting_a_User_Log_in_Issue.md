## Lab 4 Exercise 4 Troubleshooting a User Log in Issue
1. Max Taylor has complained to you, the site administrator, that he can't log in to your site. He needs access to Jira Software.
2. As the `site administrator`, resolve the problem.
3. Navigate to the `Users` site administration page and click to view `Max Taylor`. Review his account settings to find and fix the problem.
* **Question**: Does he have access on the site?
* **Answer**: No, he doesn't have access to the site.
4. Check the products listed in his profile.
5. Click the Add products button to add Jira Software to his account. You can add other products as well.
* **Note**: It's easy to revoke and restore site access by simply clicking the ... beside a product and then click on Remove product access. To restore access you just add the product back to the user. You can leave the products checked but once you remove site access the user can't log in and they will no longer consume any product licenses. This can be useful for users such as contractors who are used regularly but you don't want to give them continuous access. You can simply restore their site access when they return and they are given access to the products they need.
6. Click the three dots at the top right of Max's account page.
a. Note, but don't click, the option to remove the user.
b. Don't remove Max but this is where you would do so if you needed to remove a user.
